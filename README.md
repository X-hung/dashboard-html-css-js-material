# Introduction

This is a starter boilerplate for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project, you can use it to quickly start creating your own project for practices.


# Best Practices

Development process:
Find a design inspiration (prototype) -> Analyze layout, components, and `div`s -> extract media resources -> Iterative Implementation. 

Iteratively Design and Implement
HTML elements -> Layout -> Style -> Animation

When designing layout: 
- Using `border-style: solid`, `border-color: lightgray`, `border-radius: 8px` to explicitly display the border of each `div` panel.

When designing style:
- Identify common styles applied among components (e.g. font, color, shadow, animation)
- Make them variables.
